## 🎯 What This Enables

After 4-hour one-time setup:

```
Developer Action: git push origin main
                        ↓
System (Automatic):
  • CodePipeline detects change
  • CodeBuild compiles code
  • CodeDeploy deploys to EC2
  • Application live in 2-3 minutes
                        ↓
Result: Zero-downtime deployment
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### One-Time Investment
- Your team's time: ~5 hours
- AWS setup cost: $0

### Monthly Operating Cost
```
EC2 t3.small server        $10
CodePipeline               $1
CodeBuild usage            $5
S3 artifact storage        <$1
────────────────────────
Total:                     ~$16/month
```

### Per-Deployment Cost
```
<$0.01 per deployment
(Negligible)
